PRINTZ HONOR BOOK FIVE STARRED REVIEWS Ed Kennedy is an underage cabdriver without much of a future. He's pathetic at playing cards, hopelessly in love with his best friend, Audrey, and utterly devoted to his coffee-drinking dog, the Doorman. His life is one of peaceful routine and incompetence until he inadvertently stops a bank robbery. That's when the first ace arrives in the mail. That's when Ed becomes the messenger. Chosen to care, he makes his way through town helping and hurting (when necessary) until only one question remains: Who's behind Ed's mission?",

This \u201chighly erudite celebration and exploration of Tolkien\u2019s works [is] enormous fun,\u201d declared the Houston Chronicle, and Tom Shippey, a prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy, \u201cdeepens your understanding\u201d without \u201cmaking you forget your initial, purely instinctive response to Middle-earth and hobbits.\u201d In a clear and accessible style, Shippey offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature. He breaks down The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic feast for the senses and as a response to the human instinct for myth. Elsewhere, he examines The Hobbit\u2019s counterintuitive relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth; demonstrates the significance of The Silmarillion to Tolkien\u2019s canon; and takes an illuminating look at lesser-known works in connection with Tolkien\u2019s life. Furthermore, he ties all these strands together in a continuing tradition that traces its roots back through Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales to Beowulf. \u201cShippey\u2019s commentary is the best so far in elucidating Tolkien\u2019s lovely myth,\u201d wrote Harper\u2019s Magazine. J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century is \u201ca triumph\u201d (Chicago Sun-Times) that not only gives readers a deeper understanding of Tolkien and his work, but also serves as an entertaining introduction to some of the most influential novels ever written.",

This \u201chighly erudite celebration and exploration of Tolkien\u2019s works [is] enormous fun,\u201d declared the Houston Chronicle, and Tom Shippey, a prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy, \u201cdeepens your understanding\u201d without \u201cmaking you forget your initial, purely instinctive response to Middle-earth and hobbits.\u201d In a clear and accessible style, Shippey offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature. He breaks down The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic feast for the senses and as a response to the human instinct for myth. Elsewhere, he examines The Hobbit\u2019s counterintuitive relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth; demonstrates the significance of The Silmarillion to Tolkien\u2019s canon; and takes an illuminating look at lesser-known works in connection with Tolkien\u2019s life. Furthermore, he ties all these strands together in a continuing tradition that traces its roots back through Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales to Beowulf. \u201cShippey\u2019s commentary is the best so far in elucidating Tolkien\u2019s lovely myth,\u201d wrote Harper\u2019s Magazine. J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century is \u201ca triumph\u201d (Chicago Sun-Times) that not only gives readers a deeper understanding of Tolkien and his work, but also serves as an entertaining introduction to some of the most influential novels ever written.",

This \u201chighly erudite celebration and exploration of Tolkien\u2019s works [is] enormous fun,\u201d declared the Houston Chronicle, and Tom Shippey, a prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy, \u201cdeepens your understanding\u201d without \u201cmaking you forget your initial, purely instinctive response to Middle-earth and hobbits.\u201d In a clear and accessible style, Shippey offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature. He breaks down The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic feast for the senses and as a response to the human instinct for myth. Elsewhere, he examines The Hobbit\u2019s counterintuitive relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth; demonstrates the significance of The Silmarillion to Tolkien\u2019s canon; and takes an illuminating look at lesser-known works in connection with Tolkien\u2019s life. Furthermore, he ties all these strands together in a continuing tradition that traces its roots back through Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales to Beowulf. \u201cShippey\u2019s commentary is the best so far in elucidating Tolkien\u2019s lovely myth,\u201d wrote Harper\u2019s Magazine. J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century is \u201ca triumph\u201d (Chicago Sun-Times) that not only gives readers a deeper understanding of Tolkien and his work, but also serves as an entertaining introduction to some of the most influential novels ever written.",

His life is one of peaceful routine and incompetence until he inadvertently stops a bank robbery. That's when the first ace arrives in the mail. That's when Ed becomes the messenger. Chosen to care, he makes his way through town helping and hurting (when necessary) until only one question remains: Who's behind Ed's mission?",

And all with the help of hard work, hope\u2026 and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies\u2014and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew\u2014and the friends he encounters along the way\u2014will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph\u2026 in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust. Author Jami Farleigh invites you to meet a rich tapestry of characters, and to travel through a world that blends fantasy, laughter, coming of age, and evocative literary stylings to create a perfect escape. Fans of The Goblin Emperor, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, The Language of Flowers, and Quarter Share will delight in this tale of humor, humanity, and the power of hope.

The plagues of the past\u2014the worship of greed and pursuit of power\u2014are gone. Now, the communities that remain in this post-apocalyptic world focus on creating connections, on forging futures filled with family and love. And all with the help of hard work, hope\u2026 and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies\u2014and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew\u2014and the friends he encounters along the way\u2014will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph\u2026 in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust. Author Jami Farleigh invites you to meet a rich tapestry of characters, and to travel through a world that blends fantasy, laughter, coming of age, and evocative literary stylings to create a perfect escape. Fans of The Goblin Emperor, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, The Language of Flowers, and Quarter Share will delight in this tale of humor, humanity, and the power of hope.

The plagues of the past\u2014the worship of greed and pursuit of power\u2014are gone. Now, the communities that remain in this post-apocalyptic world focus on creating connections, on forging futures filled with family and love. And all with the help of hard work, hope\u2026 and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies\u2014and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew\u2014and the friends he encounters along the way\u2014will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph\u2026 in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust. Author Jami Farleigh invites you to meet a rich tapestry of characters, and to travel through a world that blends fantasy, laughter, coming of age, and evocative literary stylings to create a perfect escape. Fans of The Goblin Emperor, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, The Language of Flowers, and Quarter Share will delight in this tale of humor, humanity, and the power of hope.

The plagues of the past\u2014the worship of greed and pursuit of power\u2014are gone. Now, the communities that remain in this post-apocalyptic world focus on creating connections, on forging futures filled with family and love. And all with the help of hard work, hope\u2026 and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies\u2014and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew\u2014and the friends he encounters along the way\u2014will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph\u2026 in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust. Author Jami Farleigh invites you to meet a rich tapestry of characters, and to travel through a world that blends fantasy, laughter, coming of age, and evocative literary stylings to create a perfect escape. Fans of The Goblin Emperor, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, The Language of Flowers, and Quarter Share will delight in this tale of humor, humanity, and the power of hope.

The plagues of the past\u2014the worship of greed and pursuit of power\u2014are gone. Now, the communities that remain in this post-apocalyptic world focus on creating connections, on forging futures filled with family and love. And all with the help of hard work, hope\u2026 and a little bit of magic. Artist Matthew Sugiyama knows this well. Traveling the countryside in search of the family he lost as a child, he trades his art for supplies\u2014and uses his honed magic to re-draw the boundaries of reality, to fashion a world that is better for those he meets. Following glimpses of visions half-seen, Matthew\u2014and the friends he encounters along the way\u2014will travel a path from light to darkness and back again. A road where things lost in the past can only be found in the love of the present, and the hope for the future. And he will travel this path wherever it leads. From joy to sorrow, from tears to laughter. Because Matthew is the Elemental Artist, and he knows that though dangers arise, humanity will always triumph\u2026 in a world he has painted in shades of Oil and Dust. Author Jami Farleigh invites you to meet a rich tapestry of characters, and to travel through a world that blends fantasy, laughter, coming of age, and evocative literary stylings to create a perfect escape. Fans of The Goblin Emperor, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, The Language of Flowers, and Quarter Share will delight in this tale of humor, humanity, and the power of hope.
